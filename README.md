# nim-binstreams

**Work in progress, not ready for public use yet!**

## Dependencies

* `endians2` from [status/stew](https://github.com/status-im/nim-stew)

## Quickstart

```nim
import binstreams

# Create a new big-endian file stream for writing.
# File modes work exactly like with `open`.
var fs = newFileStream("outfile", bigEndian, fmWrite)

# There's just a generic `write()` proc to write single values. The width of
# the value is determined from the type and endianness conversions are handled
# automatically, if required.
fs.write(3'i8)
fs.write(42'i16)
fs.write(0xcafe'u16)

# Writing multiple values from a buffer (openArray) is just as easy.
var buf = newSeq[float32](100)
fs.write(buf, startIndex=5, numValues=30)

# It is possible to change the endiannes of the stream at any time.
fs.endian = littleEndian
fs.write(12.34'f32)
fs.write(0xcafebabe'i32)
fs.write(0xffee81'u64)

# Helpers for writing strings, chars and bools are provided.
fs.writeStr("some UTF-8 string")
fs.writeChar('X')
fs.writeBool(true)

# You can set the file position at any time.
fs.setPosition(0)
fs.write(88'u8)

fs.close()


# We can also create a new stream from a valid file handle.
var f = open("outfile")
fs = newFileStream(f, bigEndian)

# The type of the value needs to be specified when doing single-value reads.
echo fs.read(int8)
echo fs.read(uint8)

fs.endian = littleEndian
echo fs.read(int16)
echo fs.read(float32)

# Helpers for strings, chars and bools.
echo fs.readStr(10)
echo fs.readChar()
echo fs.readBool()

# Reading multiple values into a buffer
fs.setPosition(5)
var readBuf = newSeq[int16](30)
fs.read(buf, startIndex=5, numValues=10)
```
